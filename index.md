## 🔎 Interests
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Applied AI in Healthcare and Bioinformatics
- Data Analysis, Visualization, and Storytelling
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Skills
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Model validation and performance optimization

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools
- **Python**
- **NumPy**, **pandas**
- **scikit-learn**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

I’m dedicated, curious, and collaborative — always looking for opportunities to learn, build, and contribute to impactful data and ML projects.
