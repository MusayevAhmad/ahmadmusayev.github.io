I am a Bachelor’s student in **Artificial Intelligence at VU Amsterdam** with a strong technical background and a primary focus on the **application of AI within the medical domain**.  

My academic and professional interests lie in leveraging artificial intelligence to advance healthcare through **medical data analysis**, **diagnostic support**, and **intelligent systems** that improve patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

In addition to my focus on medical AI, I am deeply interested in **bioinformatics**, **health informatics**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**.  

My technical skill set includes:
- Machine Learning & Data Science
